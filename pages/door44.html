    <h1>The Origin of Gus Bombeater</h1>
    <p>You do not deny Gus Bombeater. You just don’t. Because one day it’s 2 AM, you’re soaking in the tub, trying to wind down, and suddenly across the cosmos you hear that gravelly New Orleans voice: “Heard you slacked three days on the squats last week.”</p>
    <p>And here’s the thing: you already did them once. But Gus doesn’t care. He keeps the books. You missed days, you make them up. That’s the square deal. His program is simple: Bring Sally Up squats, 3:45 minutes, every day, no exception. Sometimes with a 32‑pound weight vest and 15s in each hand, because baby food is for babies, and Gus doesn’t train babies. Add 90 seconds of old‑school sit‑ups, or worse—240 seconds of straight ab torment. If you can’t crank out ten pushups, you’re a wimp, and your underpants go up a flagpole with “Pansie Panties” scrawled in Sharpie across the butt, initials and all, so the whole of Wargon knows who folded. And he’ll still say it’s good for you. That’s his style of encouragement.</p>
    <p>And don’t think sick days count. Gus forgives those. But he will sniff out any other excuse. Once I skipped, just once, and he called a bomb threat in to my office. Later he claimed he was just trying to take me out to lunch. With Gus, you can’t be sure.</p>
    <p>You may think this is violent. But Gus doesn’t get violent. He tanks violence itself. Picture it: a tank roaring down your street, Gus riding it like a limo, standing proud, chewing live rounds from the turret like sunflower seeds while The Turtles’ “Happy Together” blasts from the belly of the beast. You’re the one left explaining to the cops, the fire brigade, the press why your name is on all the paperwork. That’s what happens when you try to deny Gus Bombeater.</p>
    <p>He tests you in stranger ways too. I was once on a first date, candlelight, normal night. Out of nowhere: Gus. Left hand, dartboard. Right hand, TNTs disguised as cigarettes. He yells across the bar, “What the fuck you lookin’ at?” to my date, just to see if the man would shrink, fight, or smooth it over. He failed the test: aggressive and scared, the double‑loser. Gus ruined the date, but saved me the wasted time. Then he bought me onion rings, and made me do the Bring Sally Up squats, right there in the bar.</p>
    <p>But none of this is his beginning. Gus Bombeater earned his throne the day he ate the last bomb on Warplanet. When the skies were black with fire and the bullies were stockpiled with endless arsenals, Gus simply swallowed it all. Grenades, nukes, dynamite, missiles—straight down into his iron belly, each one detonating only as a faint rumble inside him.</p>
    <p>And then, finally, silence. Everyone but the bullies cheered. And there were only a handful of them left, because there always are. The people made him Eternal Emperor, Guardian of the planet, which he renamed Wargon. And what was the first thing Gus did when he sat on the throne? He broke down and wept like a baby. Because he hadn’t mourned his wife. Nobody on the planet had. And when Gus finally cried, the whole of Wargon cried too. Their tears—green and blue—washed the land clean. The wars ended. The soil was pristine.</p>
    <p>Now, Gus remains a mystery. Semi‑literate, maybe. Or maybe it’s just the accent. He’s been seen skiing. He once drank jet fuel from a wine glass wearing a cashmere scarf, and it looked right. That’s the square deal with Gus Bombeater. A man who doesn’t fight, but swallows war. A man who punishes laziness but forgives sickness. A man who weeps for his wife and makes a whole planet weep too. You don’t deny him. You don’t second‑guess him. You just do the squats.</p>
